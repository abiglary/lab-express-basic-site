        <h1>In the grim dark future of the 41st century, there is only war.</h1>

        <p>
          It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries The
          Emperor has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the
          Master of Mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million
          worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting
          carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology.
          He is the Carrion Lord of the Imperium for whom a thousand souls are
          sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly die.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yet even in his deathless state, the Emperor continues his eternal
          vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the
          Warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the
          Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor's will. Vast
          armies give battle in his name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst
          his soldiers are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines,
          bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the
          Imperial Guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever
          vigilant Inquisition and the tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to
          name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough
          to hold off the ever-present threat from aliens, heretics, mutants -
          and worse.
        </p>

        <p>
          To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is
          to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are
          the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science,
          for so much has been forgotten, never to be re-learned. Forget the
          promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future
          there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an
          eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods.
